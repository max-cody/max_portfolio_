            <li><strong>1940</strong> Upon returning to england there was a significant political fallout within the war office and parliment over the disaster, Montgomery was relegated to divisional command of the 3rd division. During this time he was made a companion in the order of the bath which was an ancient knightly order dating back to the middle ages. During this year numerous smaller invasions of cork in ireland and Cape Verde, there was a wrry the irish would side with the axis forces and allow troops into ireland.</li>

These troops became the most drilled and disciplined troops in the UK. During this time the Commandos were stood up and began raids in norway and mainland france.</li>
            <li><strong>1942</strong> A new field commander was required for the middle east theatre. The british empire had a strong presence in Iraq, mesopotamia, the Sinai peninsular and egypt. The italians who had invaded Abyssinia declared war on the british in hopes of an early victory and surrender. The commonwealth troops had pushed the Italians to breaking point during operation compass. A the the second battle of El alamein Montgomery broke the back of the german Afrika Korps and the remnants of the Italian army and forced their retreat into Tunisia. Operation torch occurred in november 1942 and was the first engagement by american forces against the Axis powers, the encircle several hundred thousand Afrika Korp troops trying to retreat to Italy.

Montgomery left the theatre on the 23rd of decemberto return to england.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1944</strong>Upon returning to Britain Montgomery began planning operation Overlord alongside general Eisenhower and general Athur Tedder. This invasion began on the sixth of june and committed 1.5 million troops from a coalition of 13 countries, by late august this number and swelled to just over 2 million fighting men moving across france. Montgomery faced Erwin Rommel a second time at the battle of caen. The plan was to draw the german Panzers into a drawn out engagement whilst the americans further west break out and make for Paris. On july 7 operation charnwood began with a carpet bombing of the city of Caen and the surrounding countryside. 3 divisions totalling 700 tanks were loosed on the city. The French resistance had played a pivotal role in their small way called plan violet where they cut and destroyed much of the telephone infrastructure in france leading to the Nazi high command having to use enigma which had been cracked. Caen was captured on august 6th and allowed the commonwealth forces to breakout of normandy and begin the pushto the rhine.
        During this time more troops came in who were american and overall command was removed from Montgomery and given to Eisenhower. Montgomery was given command of the newly minted paratroopers and operation market garden took place on 17th of september to create a 100km salient into german territory to outflank the sigfried line and secure a bridgehead to over the river rhine, overall the operation failed to be the strategic breakthrough.</li>
